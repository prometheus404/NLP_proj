AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
Brass: Lancashire tells the story of
competing entrepreneurs in Lancashire
and the surrounding area during England’s
Industrial Revolution, between the years
1770-1870. During the game, you will
expand your empire by establishing canals
and rails, and building and developing
various industries, including Cotton Mills,
Coal Mines, Iron Works, Shipyards, and
Ports.

Sir Richard Arkwright

Eliza Tinsley

James Watt

Robert Owen

Isambard Kingdom Brunel

George Stephenson

Sir Henry Bessemer

Eleanor Coade

(23 December 1732 – 3 August 1792)
Taught to read and write by his cousin,
Arkwright began as an apprentice barber,
but after an early widowing his business
ambitions grew, and his second marriage
provided the funds to pursue wigmaking.
When wigs fell out of fashion, he turned
to textiles and made improvements on
the spinning jenny with the clockmaker
John Kay. Taking his business to the
small village of Cromford, Arkwright
encouraged weavers with large families to
move there and work in his mill, including
children as young as seven. Arkwright
pioneered the use of the steam engine with
textile machinery, a precursor to Edmund
Cartwright’s development of the power
loom. In his later years, after an extended
court battle, Arkwright lost many of his
patents and his domination of the textile
industry, but shortly after this he was
knighted. Ambitious, religiously devout, and
at times difficult to work with, Arkwright’s
ingenuity and organizational skills would
make him known as the “father of the
modern industrial factory system.”

(17 January 1813 – 17 January 1882)
Following the death of her husband
Thomas and his father, along with the
death of her eldest of six children, Tinsley
continued both her late husband and her
late father-in-law’s businesses in the Black
Country as one under her own name. The
Eliza Tinsley company produced nails for
horseshoes, and chains and anchors for
ships, the latter of which would become
the focus as motor vehicles replaced
horses. Chainmaking was a particularly
male-dominated industry, but Tinsley
excelled, employing around 4000 workers,
and she established an offshoot company
in Australia. Many of Tinsley’s employees
were women and young girls, and she
fought against government efforts to restrict
women, and girls under 14, from working
in the nail and chainmaking industries,
arguing that “the conditions of both
trades are favourable to moral and physical
health.” Known as “The Widow,” Tinsley
was respected for her industry expertise.
She sold the company at 58, but it would
continue operating under her name into the
21st century.

(9 April 1806 – 15 September 1859)
At the age of 15, Brunel’s father Marc was
sent to a debtors’ prison, but his debts
were paid by the British government
when he made it known that the Tsar had
offered him a position as an engineer in
Russia. Brunel studied in France under
the clockmaker Abraham Louis Breguet.
Upon returning to England he became
an assistant on Marc’s project to create a
tunnel under the Thames, but a nearlyfatal flooding incident put the 22-year-old
out of commission for several months.
This didn’t stop Brunel from becoming
one of the most prolific engineers in
history, creating tunnels, bridges, railways, a
portable hospital, and a vacuum-powered
‘atmospheric railway’, though unfortunately
for the latter the leather flaps sealing the
vacuum pipes were eaten by rats. His ‘Great
Western’ was the first steamship to conduct
transatlantic service, and his ‘Great Eastern’
was the largest ship ever built up to that
time, but Brunel died of a stroke at 53 just
before her maiden voyage. Brunel is known
today as an engineering giant.

(9 June 1781 – 12 August 1848)
After the death of his wife and daughter,
the 25-year-old Stephenson, having no
formal education, left for Scotland to find
work but returned to West Moor when his
father was blinded in a mining accident.
When he offered to improve the mine’s
deficient pumping engine, Stephenson
was made enginewright and became
an expert in steam-engine technology.
His Northumberland accent made him
unpopular with the scientific community,
and when he presented his design for a
safer mining lamp that would not cause
explosions, the Royal Society accused him
of stealing the concept from
parallel-inventor Humphry Davy. But
Stephenson’s big claim to fame was his
contribution to rail transport, and the
invigoration of the rail industry. At age 40
he began work on the first public railway,
and his locomotive known as ‘Stephenson’s
Rocket’ won a competition by achieving the
record speed of 36 miles per hour, which
led some to fear that such speeds would
cause women’s uteruses to literally fly out of
their bodies. Thankfully this did not occur.

(30 January 1736 – 25 August 1819)
Tinkering with models and ship’s
instruments at his father’s workbench from
an early age, Watt left for Glasgow at 17 to
learn to make measuring instruments such
as scales and compasses, and befriended
the chemist Joseph Black. In his 30s, while
repairing a model of the Newcomen steam
engine used widely for pumping water out
of mines, Watt noticed that the design
wasted energy on cooling and reheating
the cylinder, and he improved upon it by
adding a separate condenser which would
revolutionize the steam engine. However he
was unable to make progress on this venture
for several years as he was busy at his day
job surveying Scottish canals. This changed
when English manufacturer Matthew
Boulton took an interest in his patent,
and Watt moved to Birmingham to form
a partnership that would last 25 years and
spread his improved steam engine across
the world of industry. Though a somewhat
feeble businessman on his own (Watt once
said he “would rather face a loaded cannon
than settle an account or make a bargain”),
he was greatly respected by his peers, and
the basic unit of power, the “watt,” bears
his name.

(14 May 1771 – 17 November 1858)
Falling in love with Caroline Dale, daughter
to the owner of the New Lanark mill
co-founded by Richard Arkwright, Owen
convinced his business partners to purchase
the mill. He ran it with great success, but
displeased his partners with egalitarian
activities such as paying wages to his
workers over a four month period in which
the mills were closed during the War of
1812. An avid scholar, Owen became critical
of prevailing religious thought on human
self-determinism, and he developed his
own philosophy that one’s circumstances
are largely the result of external forces, and
that therefore education and philanthropy
should be paramount in society. He
undertook a variety of social reform
projects such as lobbying for workers and
children’s rights and for an 8-hour work
day, and temporarily left Britain to found
a socialist commune in America called
New Harmony. The experiment was an
economic failure that bankrupted Owen,
but it did produce one of the first public
libraries and a free school open to both boys
and girls, and his philosophies are deeply
woven into socialist movements within the
United States.

(19 January 1813 – 15 March 1898)
Like Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s father,
Bessemer’s father Anthony was forced to
flee France during the French Revolution.
Anthony had become a member of
the Académie des sciences at 26 for his
improvements on the optical microscope,
and made his fortune in Britain with a
process for making gold chains. Bessemer’s
first innovation mirrored his father’s
affinity for gold. After carefully analyzing
bronze powder from Nuremberg, used in
the manufacture of gold paint, he reverse
engineered the process and created a series
of six steam-powered machines that could
manufacture the powder. He later developed
a cheap system of creating steel by blowing
air through molten pig iron to burn off
impurities. The goal was initially to reduce
the cost of military ordnance, but this
technique of affordable steel revolutionized
structural engineering and made bridges
and railroad tracks, previously reliant
on wrought and cast iron, much safer.
Bessemer pioneered over 100 inventions
in the fields of metalworking and glass,
including a steamship cabin on gimbals
intended to stay level to prevent seasickness
which was sadly lost at sea, and he gained
considerable commercial success leveraging
his innovations.

(3 June 1733 – 16 November 1821)
Bringing her up a devout Baptist, Coade’s
parents were both successful merchants.
Her grandmother Sarah Enchmarch had
run the family textile business in Tiverton
with 200 employees, using spies to acquire
new manufacturing techniques, and was
known for travelling around town in a
sedan chair. After Coade’s family moved
to London, she ran her own linen draper
business at age 30. Six years later she
purchased an artificial stone business from
the struggling Daniel Pincot, but fired him
within two years for “representing himself
as the chief proprietor.” Her ceramic
stoneware called “Coade’s Lithodipyra”
went on to be used in over 700 sculptures
across the globe, many of them overseen
by the sculptor John Bacon, though she
worked with a number of high-profile
designers and architects as it allowed her to
produce multiple copies of their designs.
The South Bank Lion may be Coade’s
most iconic piece, but her product was
also used for the Gothic screen of St
George’s Chapel, and in the restoration of
Buckingham Palace.

THE GOAL

The game is played over 2 eras:
the Canal Era (1770-1830) and
the Rail Era (1830-1870). The
winner is the player who has the
most Victory Points (VPs) following the end
of the Rail Era. VPs are scored at the end
of each era for your Link tiles and flipped
Industry tiles.

ROUNDS
Each era is played in rounds, which continue
until both the Draw Deck and players’
Hands are exhausted. There are exactly
8/9/10 rounds per era in a 4/3/2-players
game. During each round, players take turns
in the order of their Character tiles on the
Turn Order Track.

INCREASING YOUR INCOME

CONSUMING IRON

Whenever one of your
Industry tiles is flipped,
immediately advance your
Income Marker along the
Progress Track A by the
number of spaces (not income
levels) shown in the bottom right corner of
the tile.

Iron is required to perform the Develop
action, and to build certain Industry tiles.

CONSUMING COAL
Coal is required to build rail Links and
certain Industry tiles.
To consume coal, a rail Link or Industry tile
must be connected to a source of coal (after
it is placed).

Coal must be consumed from:
1

To consume iron, an Industry tile does not
need a connection to a source of iron.

Iron must be consumed from:

YOUR NETWORK
A location on the board is considered to be
a part of your network if at least one of the
following is true:

Any unflipped Iron Works F
(owned by any player); it does not
have to be the closest. If you need
more than 1 iron, you can consume
each iron from a different Iron
Works. Consuming iron in this way
is free.
If there are no unflipped Iron
Works, you can purchase iron from
the Iron Market G , starting at the
cheapest price. If the Iron Market is
empty, you can still purchase iron for
£5 /
.

2

The closest (fewest Link tiles distant)
connected unflipped Coal Mine H
(owned by any player). If multiple
Coal Mines are equally close, choose
one. If a Coal Mine runs out of
coal, and you need more, choose the
next closest Coal Mine. Consuming
coal in this way is free.
If you are not connected to an
unflipped Coal Mine, you can
purchase coal from the Coal Market
I , starting at the cheapest price.
This requires a connection to the
market trade icon
(shown on
all flipped or unflipped Port tiles J ,
and some locations around the edge
of the board K ). If the Coal
Market is empty, you can still
purchase coal for £5 /
.

• The location contains one or more of
your Industry tiles B ;
• The location is adjacent to one or more
of your Link tiles C .

CONNECTED LOCATIONS

Consumed iron cubes are placed back into
the General Supply.

Consumed coal cubes are placed back into
the General Supply.

Historical Note: These industries generally
required iron in low volumes, so it could also
be transported via horse and wagon.

Historical Note: Coal was required in
large quantities, so a robust transportation
network was critical.

Two locations are considered “connected”
to each other if you can trace a route of
Link tiles (owned by any player) from one
location D to the other E .

Exception: You cannot increase your
income level above level 30.

A C T I O N S

Discard an appropriate card. Unlike
other actions, which allow you to use
any card from your Hand, the Build
action requires an appropriate card
be discarded face up onto your
Discard Pile:

• Location card
May be used to build
any Industry tile at the
location named on the
card, even if the location
is not a part of your
network.
• Industry card
May be used to build the
matching Industry tile,
shown in the top corner
of the card, in a location
that is a part of your
network.

• If possible, place it on a
N
space displaying only
that industry’s icon M .
• Otherwise, place it on a
space displaying that
industry’s icon with
another industry’s icon
N .
• If no undeveloped
spaces display your industry’s icon,
you may not place it in that location.
Exception: (see “Overbuilding”)

• Double Action

Build

May be used instead
of both of your turn’s
actions. Discard any 2
cards and regard them
as any 1 Location card.
You still refill your Hand
with 2 cards, if possible.
Note: In 2/3-player
games you may still build in any
location.

Moving Coal and Iron to the
Market

Take the lowest level tile of the
chosen industry from your Player
Mat L and place it (the side with
the black top half face down) on an
undeveloped space in your chosen
build location, obeying the following
rules:

If you build either a:

• Coal Mine that is connected to the
market trade icon
(shown on all flipped or
unflipped Port tiles, and
some locations around the
edge of the board);

or

M

The cost of the Industry tile you are
building is displayed, to the left of its
slot, on your Player Mat O . Place
money onto your Character tile on
the Turn Order Track, and consume
any required iron and coal O .
Remember: If coal is required, the
location you are building in must be
connected to a source of coal (see
“Consuming Coal” and “Connected
Locations”).
If you built a Coal Mine
or Iron Works: Place
coal
or iron
(from the General
Supply) onto the
Industry tile, equal to
the quantity shown in
the bottom right corner
of the tile.

• Iron Works, regardless
of whether or not it is
connected to the market
trade icon;
you must do the
following:
1 Immediately move as many cubes
as possible from the Industry tile
to available spaces in its associated
Market (filling the most expensive
spaces first).

2

For each cube moved, collect the
corresponding amount of money
displayed on the coin to the left
side of its Market space P .

3

If the last cube is moved from
your Industry tile to its Market, flip
the Industry tile Q and advance
your Income Marker along the
Progress Track by the number of
spaces shown in the bottom right
corner of the tile.

Building If You Have No Tiles
on the Board
If you have no Industry
or Link tiles on the board,
you may also (as an action)
discard an Industry card to
build the matching Industry
tile in any location with an
undeveloped space displaying
that industry’s icon.

Building A Shipyard

Shipyard tiles that show a
may not be built. These tiles
may only be removed from your
Player Mat through use of the
Develop action. They must be
removed before you can access the higherlevel Shipyard tiles.

Canal Era Building

• You may have a maximum of 1 Industry
tile per location, but may have an
Industry tile in the same location as
other players.

BUILD ACTION (CONTINUED)

SELL ACTION

LOAN ACTION

DEVELOP ACTION

Overbuilding

Performing the Sell action allows you to flip
built Cotton Mill tiles, and sometimes Port tiles.

Performing the Loan action allows you
to acquire more money. Loans are never
repaid, but instead lower your income level.
• You may not take a loan during the final
4 rounds of the Rail Era (when there are
no cards left in the Draw Deck).
• To aid you in
remembering this,
the preceding
round will end
with the last player
refilling their Hand
and revealing the
Deck tile, Nathan
Rothschild side up.
• When the Deck
tile appears, place
it beside the Bank
to indicate that the
next round is the last round in which
you may take loans.
• Following the final round
for loans, flip the Deck tile
over to the Stephenson’s
Rocket side, to indicate
that you can no longer take
loans.

Performing the Develop action allows you
to remove Industry tiles from your Player
Mat. This allows you to gain access to
higher-level Industry tiles without having
to build all of the lower-level tiles of that
industry.

Sometimes you are allowed to replace an
already placed Industry tile with a higherlevel tile of the same industry type (you
must still pay the necessary build costs).
This is known as Overbuilding. When
Overbuilding:
If the tile you are replacing is your own
A :
• You may Overbuild any Industry tile.
• If there are any iron / coal cubes on the
tile being replaced, place them back into
the General Supply.
If the tile you are replacing is owned by
an opponent B :
• You may Overbuild only a Coal Mine or
an Iron Works.
• There must be no resource cubes on the
entire board, including in its Market, of
the same type as the Industry tile being
replaced.
Remove overbuilt Industry tiles from the
game, and return them to the box (they
will not score VPs). Players do not lose
previously gained income or VPs if their
Industry tiles are overbuilt.

Link built (see “Consuming Coal”).
Remember: Each rail Link is placed
separately and must be connected to a
source of coal (after it is placed).

• You may not build rail Links.
• You may build canal Links on
undeveloped canal lines M .

THINGS TO REMEMBER

BEGINNER TIPS

CLASSIC RULES

• Discard 1 card for every single action
you perform, including passing.
• Only Build actions need a specific card.
• You can perform the same action twice
in a turn. For instance, you may place 1
or 2 rail Links with the Network action,
then use the Network action again to
place 1 or 2 rail Links.
• You may also discard any 2 cards to use
both of your actions at the same time.
This allows you to build any Industry
tile in any location with a space for that
industry.
• During the Canal Era, each player may
place a maximum of 1 of their Industry
tiles in each location.
• You may Overbuild any of your own
Industry tiles at any time.
• You may also Overbuild opponents’
Coal Mines/Iron Works, but only when
there are no coal/iron cubes left on any
Industry tiles or in the Market.
• You must be connected to a
icon
to sell cotton, and to consume coal (but
not iron) from the Market.
• A location must be a part of your
network for you to build there (unless
you use that specific Location card or
the double-action build).

• Do not be afraid of taking loans. Your
income level at the end of the game is
not worth VPs. It is not uncommon
for experienced players to win the game
despite having a low income level.
• Level 2 or greater Industry tiles are not
removed at the end of the Canal Era,
so could score twice if built early. A
flipped level 3 Cotton Mill would score
a whopping 18 VPs over both eras. The
Develop action is your friend.
• Tiles with a
icon to the left of
their slot on your Player Mat cannot be
built during the Rail Era. Try to build
or develop at least 1 Coal Mine and 1
Iron Works during the Canal Era, so
that you do not have to use a Develop
action during the Rail Era to clear these
industries from your Player Mat.
• Nobody likes passing. During the Rail
Era, when the Deck tile is revealed
Nathan Rothschild side up, you have
only one more round to take loans. If
you are short on money, make sure you
take at least one loan, or you may find
yourself unable to do much during the
final rounds of the game.
• Figuring out how best to expand your
network at the beginning of the Rail Era
can be difficult for beginners. Expand
your network by building rail Links
to sources of coal. If you don’t have
access to any coal, build a Coal Mine.

Roxley strongly recommends you play using
the updated and streamlined rules outlined
in this manual. But in case you are feeling
nostalgic, you can play the original game by
implementing the rule changes below.

INTRODUCTORY GAME

Players then score additional points as
follows:

Since Brass is such a deep game, some
players may prefer to play a shorter
introductory game for their first experience.
The introductory game plays exactly like the
full game, except you only play the Canal
Era and there are additional scoring rules
to make players’ scores more closely reflect
their success in the Canal Era.
To play the introductory game, first, play the
entire Canal Era as normal, including the
end of Canal Era scoring.

1

Money

2

Income level

3

Score 1 VP for
every £4 in your
player area (up to a
maximum of 15 VPs).

Score VPs equal to
your income level. If
your income level is
negative, you lose VPs.

Virtual Link

The original rules included the quirky,
rarely used, Virtual Link rule:
• If Liverpool is a part of your network,
then you may use an Industry card to
build in Birkenhead.
Remember: If coal is required, the
location you are building in must be
connected to a source of coal.
Coal does not travel across the Virtual
Link A .

Community 2-Player Variant

Brass was originally designed by Martin
Wallace as a 3-4 player game. However, in
2009, a 2-player variant was developed by
members of the Brass community. This
used a customised map and setup; with all
other rules remaining the same. Roxley’s
2018 ruleset makes this Community 2-player
variant obsolete, but we’ve included it to
preserve the history of the game. To play
the community 2-player variant, perform
the following setup changes (the rest of
the rules remain the same):
• Place the board face up
displaying the Alternate Map,
which features fewer locations
and the read manual icon in the
upper left B .
B

A

Classic 3-4 Player Deck Setup

The original rules did not have a static
list of cards that were removed during
setup. To play with the classic deck
setup, apply the following rules changes:
• Ignore step 2 in “Board Setup”.
• Instead of step 4 in “Board Setup”:
Insert the Deck tile near the bottom of
the Draw Deck, so that there are 9 cards
beneath it in a 3-player game, or 6 cards
beneath it in a 4-player game.
• After shuffling the Draw Deck when
setting up the Rail Era (step 5 of “End
of Era Maintenance - Canal Era Only”),
remove 6 cards in a 3-player game, or
2 cards in a 4-player game; and return
them to the box.

Industry tiles

Score the points a second
time for all your level 2 or
greater Industry tiles.

• Ignore the player counts on the
cards. Instead, create a 40 card
Draw Deck by removing all
cards that do not feature a cog
icon
in the bottom right corner C .
• Ignore the player counts on Distant
Cotton Market tiles. Instead, remove all
tiles that do not feature a
icon on the
left side (one “-1”, one “-3” and both
“0”) D .
• Start with £25 instead of £30.
