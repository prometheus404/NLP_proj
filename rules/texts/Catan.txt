INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the unexplored island of Catan!
As you and your fellow explorers gaze across the uninhabited landscape of hexagonal tracts of
terrain, you quickly realize that this unique land arrangement provides ample space for each of
you to put down roots.
You race off to establish your respective communities by gathering resources from nearby
terrain, building your infrastructure, and nurturing trade relationships. Watch out for surprises—
your rivals can block your path or send the robber to plunder your wealth!
Good luck, explorers!

Each player takes the resource cards from the supply that
match the hexes adjacent to their second settlement,
highlighted in black. Keep these cards hidden

TURN OVERVIEW

CATAN is played over a series of turns, starting with the first player, and moving clockwise around the table.
A turn consists of two phases, which occur in this order:
1. Production phase
2. Action phase
Once you have finished the Action phase, if you have not won, pass the dice to the player on your left.
They begin their turn with the Production phase.

PRODUCTION PHASE
PLAY A DEVELOPMENT CARD

If you have development cards, you may play one of them before rolling the dice. See “Development Cards” on page 9.

ROLL DICE
Roll both dice and add them together. This total determines which hexes produce resources this turn.

© 2025 CATAN

GmbH
CATAN

© 2025

CATAN

GmbH

© 2025
GmbH

RULES

Important: A hex with the robber does not
produce resources when its number is rolled.

6

GmbH
CATAN
GmbH

Example: White has 9 resource cards
in hand. When a 7 is rolled, they must
discard 4 cards.

GmbH

Fields produce wheat

CATAN

2. ACTIVATE THE ROBBER
You must move the robber to a new hex.
Steal 1 random resource card from a player
who has a building on that hex. If multiple
players have buildings on the new hex, you
choose one player to rob.

Pastures produce wool

© 2025

1. DISCARD RESOURCES
Each player who has more than 7 resource cards
must choose half (rounded down) of their resource
cards and return them to the supply.

© 2025
GmbH
CATAN
© 2025

RESOLVE A 7
When you roll a 7, hexes do not produce
any resources. Instead:

Forests produce wood

CATAN

If there are not enough resource cards in the
supply to fulfill everyone’s production, then no
one receives any of that resource. However, if only
one player is affected, give that player as many of
those resource cards as remain in the supply.

Example: The White player rolls an 8.
Blue has a settlement on the mountain
hex with the number 8 disc, so Blue
receives 1 ore resource card. Orange
receives 2 ore for their city on that hex.

© 2025

Similarly, a player receives 2 resource cards
for each of their cities on that hex.

Hills produce brick
CATAN

If a player has 2 or 3 settlements on that hex, they
receive 1 resource card for each settlement.

© 2025

Hexes with a number disc matching the dice roll
produce this turn. Each player with a settlement on a
producing hex receives 1 resource card
of the corresponding type from the supply.

GmbH

COLLECT RESOURCES

Mountains produce ore

Example: Orange rolls a 7. They move
the robber to the pasture hex with a
red settlement and a blue city. Orange
chooses to steal a card from Blue and
takes a random card without looking.

The desert
produces nothing

ACTION PHASE

You may take actions in this phase as often as you like and in any order, as long as you have the resources to do so.

TRADE
You may trade freely with other players and the supply to get the resources you need to build. During your turn,
other players may only trade with you, not with each other or with the supply.
There are three types of trades you may perform:
TRADE WITH OTHER PLAYERS
To trade with other players, announce which resource(s) you want and which resource(s) you are willing
to trade. Other players may accept your proposal, make counteroffers, or make their own proposals.
Important: You may not give away cards in any way, which includes trading matching resource cards
(for example, trying to trade 3 ore for 1 ore is not allowed).
Example: It is Blue’s turn, and they want 1 wheat. Orange will trade
1 wheat and wants 1 wool in return. Blue agrees and the players
exchange cards. White also wants to trade for 1 wool, but Blue
no longer has any. White may not trade with Orange because
it is not Orange’s turn.

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

GENERAL TRADE WITH THE SUPPLY (4:1)
To trade with the supply, put 4 of the same resource cards into the supply
and take 1 card of a different resource from the supply.

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

Example: White wants 1 ore. On their turn,
they may not trade 2 wheat for 1 ore because
they do not have a building on the 2:1 wheat
port. However, they may trade 3 wood for 1 ore
because they have a settlement built on a 3:1 port.

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

If you have a building on a 2:1 port, you
may put 2 of the resource cards shown
on the port into the supply and take
1 card of a different resource from
the supply.

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

PORT TRADE WITH THE SUPPLY
(3:1 OR 2:1)
If you have a building on a 3:1 port, you
may put 3 of the same resource cards
into the supply and take 1 card of a
different resource from the supply.

© 2025 CATAN GmbH

Example: It is Blue’s turn. They choose to trade 4 wood for 1 ore.

7

BUILD
Roads, buildings (settlements and cities), and development cards each have different costs. During your turn, you may
spend resources (aka “build”) to place roads and buildings on the board, as well as to take development cards from the
supply. To do so, simply return the required resource cards from your hand to the supply.
ROADS
Roads are worth 0 VP.

6

Roads are placed on empty hex edges. A new road must connect
to one of your existing roads or buildings. You may not build a road
starting on the other side of an opponent’s building.

BUILDING COST:

3:1

4

Example: Blue may place a road on any of the
edges with a check mark. They may not place
a road on the edge with an “X” because they
may not build on the other side of
Orange’s settlement.

LONGEST ROUTE

The first player to play 5 continuous roads
receives this tile. If another player plays
more, they immediately receive this tile.

v6.250401

Longest Route
The first player to have 5 continuous roads in play receives this
tile. If another player has more continuous roads in play, they
immediately receive this tile. The Longest Route tile is worth
2 VPs.
If, when a player’s route is broken (see example), they no
longer meet the requirements for the Longest Route, the tile
is returned to the supply. It remains in the supply until a single
player has the longest continuous route of at least 5 roads.
That player immediately receives the bonus tile and the 2 VPs.

Example: Red has a continuous route of 7 roads and the Longest Route
tile. White has a continuous route of 6 roads. On White’s turn, they
build a settlement at the intersection shown, breaking Red’s route into a
four-segment route and a three-segment route. Since White now has the
longest route, they receive the tile and the 2 VPs.
SETTLEMENTS
Settlements are worth 1 VP.
Settlements are placed on
empty intersections. A new
settlement must follow the Distance
Rule and must connect to at least one
of your existing roads. You have
5 settlement pieces. To continue building
more settlements, you must first upgrade
one to a city.
BUILDING COST:

8

The Distance Rule: When placing a
settlement, stay at least two edges away
from all other buildings!

Example: Orange may place a settlement
on the intersections with a check mark.

CITIES
Cities are worth 2 VPs.

BUILDING COST:

Cities always replace settlements. To build a city, remove one of your
settlements from the board, return it to your player area, and place your city
where the settlement was located. You have 4 cities and may not build more.
DEVELOPMENT CARDS
When you build a development card, draw the top card of the deck. Development cards stay
hidden until used. They do not count toward the number of cards in your hand when a 7 is
rolled, and the robber may not steal them.

BUILDING COST:

You may play 1 development card during your turn by placing it face up in your player area.
It may not be a card you built this turn. You may play a development card before rolling dice
or at any time during the Action phase.
Development cards never go back into the supply. If the supply runs out, you may not build any more cards.
You may not trade or give away development cards.
Monopoly
When you play this card, announce one
type of resource. Each player must give
you all their resource cards of that type.
You may only request one type of resource
when you play this card, regardless of
how many cards you receive.

MONOPOLY

Announce one type of
resource. Each player must
give you all their resource
cards of that type.
