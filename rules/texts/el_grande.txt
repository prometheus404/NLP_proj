15th century Spain: for almost 700 years, the conflict for dominance over the country has raged between
Christian and Muslim rulers. Spain is divided into several kingdoms, counties, provinces, and an emirate.
In addition to Catholics and Moors, Basques, Galicians, and Catalans are also fighting for supremacy in
different territories. The country‘s high nobility, called the Grandes, plays a crucial role in turning the tide
of battle. They send their brave knights, the Caballeros, to take over new regions.
With every castle they conquer and defend, their influence grows.
Who will win the battle for Spain and become “El Grande”?
Note: In Spanish, “ll” is pronounced with a “y” sound, so
Castillo becomes “ka-stee-yo“ and Caballero becomes “ka-ba-yeh-ro.”

Goal of the Game

You try to gain majority in the regions of Spain by cleverly placing your Caballeros. During each scoring, you‘ll earn points
depending on your majorities. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

Gameplay

The game plays over 9 rounds. First, you play Power cards to determine turn order. After that, each player takes their turn
using one Action card.
Every 3rd round (after the 3rd, 6th, and 9th round) a general scoring takes place. You get points for your Caballeros
depending on the majorities in each region.
Each round, perform the following phases in this order:
1. Reveal Action cards
2. Play Power cards
3. Take a turn:
• Take Caballeros to the Court
• Use an Action card (place Caballeros & perform a Special action)
4. End of the Round
5. General scoring (after the 3rd, 6th, and 9th round)

We will now explain the individual phases step by step.

1. Reveal Action cards

The player with the First Player marker begins and plays any Power card from their hand face up.
Then, in clockwise order, the other players also play one of their Power cards face up in front of them.
Your Power card must have a different value from all the Power cards that have already been played
this round.
Power card
The Power cards determine two things:
value
you take to your Court.
Turn order and the number of Caballeros

Example: Green starts and plays the 8. Blue is the next player clockwise. They may play
anything but an 8 and plays a 3. Orange is next and may play anything but an 8 or 3, so
they play a 5. Finally, you play the 9.

3. Take a turn
Each player has one turn per round. The player who played the highest Power card begins and takes their turn. After that,
the player with the 2nd highest Power card takes their turn. Then, it continues with the player who played the next highest
card, and so on.

On your turn, perform the following steps:

Take Caballeros to the Court
At the beginning of your turn, take as many Caballeros from the general supply (the Province) as are
shown on your played Power card. You put them in your personal supply, which we call Court. Later,
you will place your Caballeros in Spain (on the game board). However, you can only place Caballeros
from your Court, not from the Province.
Note: You may take fewer Caballeros than indicated on the card to your Court.
Note: If you play the 12 or 13, you cannot take new Caballeros from the Province to your Court.

Special case: If there are not enough of your Caballeros left in the Province, you may take your Caballeros from the regions on
the map (not from the Castillo) to your Court. This also applies when moving Caballeros to your Court via Action cards.

Use an Action card
Now choose one of the revealed Action cards on one of the 5 stacks. Take the card and perform both actions on it in either
order:

Special action
You may perform the Special action shown
on the top of the card.

You decide whether to perform the Special action first and then place the Caballeros, or vice versa. However, you cannot
split the actions. You must fully complete one action before performing the other.

Place Caballeros
You may place as many of your own Caballeros on the game board
as are shown on the bottom of your Action card.
The following rules apply:

• You may only use Caballeros from your Court. If you have fewer Caballeros
than shown on your Action card, you forfeit the rest.

• You may only place Caballeros in neighbor regions of the King’s region.
Neighbour regions are all regions that are directly adjacent to the region
where the King is located.

Important: You may never place Caballeros directly in the King’s region.

• You decide how many Caballeros you place in each region. You may

distribute them as you wish. You may also place less than you are allowed to.

• Instead of placing Caballeros in regions, you may throw some or all of them
into the Castillo. How exactly the Castillo works is explained on p. 6.

• France and Portugal do not count as regions, so you may never place
Caballeros there (nor your Grande or the King).

5

Example: Castilla is the King’s region.
Therefore, you may place your
Caballeros in Galicia, Navarra, Aragón,
Toledo or throw them into the Castillo.

Special action
Each Action card shows a Special action that you may perform. You may also choose to not perform the Special action at all
and only place your Caballeros (p. 5). If you perform the Special action, you must perform as much of the action as possible,
even if it benefits another player more than you (e.g. they score more points).
Note: Some cards give you options (e.g. “Move up to 4 of your own Caballeros”).
You can find an explanation of the different Special actions on p. 10-12.

You choose the “Your Majesty” Action card. You decide to place
Caballeros first. You may place up to 5 from your Court in the
King’s neighbor regions or throw them into the Castillo. The King
is in Valencia, so you place 2 Caballeros in Granada and 2 in
Toledo. You throw the last Caballero into the Castillo.

You choose the “Fiesta” Action card. It’s Special action
scores all 5-point regions (Aragón, Navarra and
Valencia). Since this would give more points to other
players, you decide not to perform the Special action.

After that, you use the Special action to move the King to
Toledo.

After that, you may place up to 3 Caballeros from the
Court on the game board. You place 1 in Aragón and
2 in Toledo.

You have now performed your Special action and placed your Caballeros. Place your used Action card face up on the discard
pile. If you used the King’s card “Your Majesty”, put it back as the 5th stack face down.
These cards are no longer available for the other players this round.
Your turn ends and the player with the next highest Power card takes their turn (see p. 4).

The Castillo
• The Castillo is not a region. When we use the term “region”, the Castillo is excluded.
• If you move Caballeros, you may never move them from the Castillo. You may, however, throw some or all of
them into the Castillo. (Moving is described on page 10).

Pull
here!

• Whenever you throw Caballeros into the Castillo, you must announce how many you are throwing in.
No one may ever check how many Caballeros are inside or take Caballeros from the Castillo.

• The only time you may open the Castillo’s gate is during a general scoring (after the 3rd, 6th, and 9th
round) or a special Castillo scoring (see p.11).

Attention: The King’s region is taboo!
Nothing in the King’s region may ever be changed. No Caballeros, Grandes, or Scoring tiles may be placed in or removed
from the King’s region. This is one of the most important rules in the game. There are no exceptions.

4. End of the round

After everyone has taken their turn, prepare for the next round by following these steps:

• Place any remaining Action cards face up on the discard pile.

5. General scoring
If the Round marker reaches a space with a lily
, a general scoring takes place.
This happens after the 3rd, the 6th, and the 9th round.
Note: See page 9 for special scoring rules for 2- and 3-player games.
Each region and the Castillo has a Scoring board that shows how many points you
get for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.
For each scoring, you perform the following steps in order:
a) Set your Secret disc
b) Score the Castillo and move Caballeros to a region
c) Score each region
The Scoring overview to the right of the round track is a reminder of these steps.

Scoring board

Scoring
Scoring overview
with symbols for each
step of the scoring
phase.

a) Set your Secret disc
First, decide where you want to move your Caballeros from the Castillo. Secretly, move the arrow on the Secret disc
to a region where you want to move your Caballeros. Then place it facedown in front of you. All of you do this step
simultaneously.
Attention: You cannot split these Caballeros across multiple regions. You must clearly choose one region.
Remember: The King's region cannot be changed in any way. If you choose the King's region with the disc or your
disc is not set clearly, your Caballeros will return to your Court instead of moving to a region.

b) Score the Castillo and move Caballeros to a region
Now you score the Castillo. Open the gate so that the Caballeros tumble out, and separate the freed Caballeros
by player color. As shown on both Scoring boards, the player who has the most Caballeros in the Castillo gets
5 points. The player with the 2nd most gets 3 points, and the 3rd most gets 1 point.
Note: The rules for a tie are explained on p. 8.
Note: Two Scoring boards are depicted next to the Castillo, so all of you can see the values clearly. Like the regions, you only score
the Castillo once.
Track your points by moving your Score marker forward on the Scoring track.
Finally, everyone simultaneously reveals their Secret disc and moves their Caballeros to their chosen region.
Example: You empty the Castillo and determine the majority. You have 3 Caballeros in the
Castillo, Blue 2 and Orange 1. You have the majority and get 5 points. Blue has the 2nd most
and gets 3 points. Orange has the 3rd most and gets 1 point. Green has no Caballeros in the
Castillo and therefore gets no points.
Then everyone reveals
their Secret disc with their
You move your marker 5 steps forward.
chosen region. You move
your 3 Caballeros from
the Castillo to Granada.

7

c) Score each region
Score each region in the order shown on the Scoring overview, from top to
bottom. Scoring regions follows the same rules as scoring the Castillo.
First you determine how many Caballeros each player has in the region.
Then, players with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most Caballeros get points according to the
Scoring board in the region. If a player has no Caballeros in a region, they get no points.
Important: Your Grande can give you bonus points (see below), but does not count toward
majority.

The regions are
scored in the order
indicated on the scoring overview,
from top to bottom
one after another.

Example: Galicia is the first region to be scored. Orange has the majority with
4 Caballeros here and gets 4 points for first place. Blue has 3 Caballeros and gets
2 points. You are in 3rd place with 2 Caballeros. Unfortunately, no points are
awarded for 3rd place in Galicia. Green doesn't get any points either, since there
is no 4th place.

Resolving ties

If some of you have the same number of Caballeros in a region or the Castillo when it is scored, all tied players score the
next lower position. It doesn’t matter how many players tie.
Example: The next region is Navarra. You, Blue, and Green each have 2 Caballeros.
Remember: The Grande of Green does not count towards the majority.
All are tied for first place, therefore you are all considered to be in 2. place and each
of you gets 3 points. Orange has 1 Caballero and gets 1 point for 3rd place.
After the scoring you move the Round marker again and begin a new round (see p. 4).
After the 3rd scoring, you proceed with “End of the game”.

King’s bonus and Grande’s bonus
If you score first place in the King’s region,
you get 2 points extra.
If you score first place in the region with your
Grande, you also get 2 points extra.
Note: In case of a tie, you never get bonus points.
These bonuses apply during both general and special scorings.
Note: It is possible to receive both the King’s bonus and the
Grande’s bonus in one region.

Scoring tile

You can place and move the two Scoring tiles only by using
the Action cards “Enactment”. They replace a printed
Scoring board in a region. There can only be one Scoring
tile in each region.

Example: Later you score Sevilla. Blue and Green each
have 2 Caballeros and therefore share 2nd place. Therefore,
Blue does not get the Grande’s bonus.
Blue and Green each get 3 points, you get 1.
In Granada you have the majority with 3 Caballeros.
Because your Grande is located there, you get 2 bonus
points. Since this is also the King’s region, you get 2 extra
points as well. You get a total of 10 points.
Orange and Green get 1 point each for 3rd place.

4

End of the game

Example: You move the
Scoring tile to Castilla to
reduce the majority points
for this region.

The game ends after the 3rd general scoring.
The player with the most points wins the game and is dubbed El Grande. In case of a tie, you share the victory (or another place).

Variations
Short game
You can also play a shorter game that lasts only 6 rounds. During setup, start the Round marker on space 2. When advancing
the Round marker, skip spaces 4 and 7.

2-player game
Set up the game as described on p. 2 and 3 with the following changes:

should now be visible.
• Flip the game board. The 2- and 3-player side
• Choose a color like usual. Choose a third color for a dummy and place the Caballeros of that color next to the game board.
Shuffle the corresponding Power cards, and place them next to it. These are the cards and Caballeros for the dummy. The
dummy also places Caballeros in Spain. It can change majorities, but does not get points.

• Shuffle the Action cards in stacks 2 and 3 and place them face down next to stack 1. You will only have 4 stacks to choose
from instead of 5.

• As usual, draw a starting region for the King. Also a Region card for both players and place their Grande and 2 Caballeros
there. Then shuffle all the Region cards and place them in a face down stack next to the dummy’s Caballeros.

Gameplay changes:
• At the beginning of each round, draw 2 Region cards. Place 2 Caballeros of the dummy in each of the drawn regions.

If all 30 are on the game board, do not draw any more Region cards. If a card shows the King’s region, do not place any
Caballeros there. Then place the cards on a discard pile. After each general scoring, shuffle all Region cards.
• Before you play a Power card, turn over the top Power card from the dummy’s stack. Then, the player with the First Player
marker begins (the dummy never gets the First Player marker). As usual, the value of the revealed Power card defines
when the dummy makes its move. As with other players, you can not play a card with the same value.
• The dummy always takes the remaining Action card with the most Caballeros shown on the bottom. Immediately put this
card on the discard pile (or flip it over if it is the King’s card). The dummy does not use the card. At the end of the round,
discard the dummy’s Power card, too.
• You may move the dummy’s Caballeros or send them back from the regions according to the normal rules. But if an
Action card would require the dummy's action (e.g. choose a region), skip the dummy.

• Scoring changes: Only the first two numbers on the Scoring board count.

3-player game
Set up the game as described on p. 2 and 3 with the following changes:

should now be visible.
• Flip the game board. The 2- and 3-player side
• Optional: Shuffle the Action cards in stacks 2 and 3 and place them face down next to stack 1. In this variant, you will only
have 4 stacks to choose from instead of 5. This makes the game more competitive.

• Scoring changes: Only the first two numbers on the Scoring board count.

Mini expansion: “New Regency”

This mini expansion offers you new possibilites for the tactical movement of the King.
Set up the game as usual, but return the King’s card to the box. Instead, shuffle the 10 Action cards
with the symbol and place them face down as the 5th stack next to the others.
The 5th stack follows the same rules as the other Action card stacks. At the beginning of each
round, you reveal the top card. At the end of the round, discard the card (whether it was used
or not) and reveal the next one from the stack.

Shuffle the Action cards as usual. Then, for each card you are adding, return 1 random card
from the corresponding stack back to the box.
For example: If you were to add all 4 cards, return 1 random card from stack 1, 2 random cards from stack 2, and 1 random card
from stack 4 back to the box.
Then, add the new Action cards to their corresponding stacks. Finally, shuffle each stack again and reveal the top card.

Mini expansion “Power Shift”

Shuffle the 16 Power Modifier cards with gray backs. Then deal 3 Modifier cards to each player. Return the remaining cards
to the box. Everyone looks at their 3 Modifier cards and passes 1 of them face down to the player to their left. Once everyone
has passed a card, add all 3 Modifier cards to your hand of Power cards.

Gameplay changes:
When playing a Power card, you may also play one of your Modifier cards. Add or subtract the number from the value of
your Power card.
Important: the total value must be different from the values that have already been played.
Example: You may play a 9 +1 (=10) if someone already played a 9.
Example: If a player before you played an 8, you cannot play a 7 +1 (=8).
If you play a Modifier card, you may use the special ability at the beginning of your turn: after taking Caballeros to your
Court, but before choosing an Action card. After your turn, discard your played Modifier card with your Power card.
At the end of the round, the person who played the lowest total value gets the First Player marker.

one of your played Modifier cards to your hand instead.

Castillo. As long as he
remains there, all of you may
place your
in all regions,
but not the Castillo.

Scoring board on the game board. You may also move a
tile that is already on the game board to another one
(but do not remove it from the game board).
This will change the points awarded during scoring. You
can also place one tile on the Castillo to replace both
Scoring boards there. You are not allowed to place a tile
in the King’s region or take one from there.

must move as many Caballeros as possible along with the
King. You forfeit the others.

Competition

Only with this card, you can throw Grandes into the
Castillo. When scoring the Castillo, you can get the
Grande’s bonus. Then move your Grande using the Secret
disc (along with your Caballeros).
Special case: After scoring the Castillo with the “Revelation”
card, throw the Grandes back into the Castillo.

Caballeros (from all players). Place the King in this
region.
You can not move the King to regions without any
Caballeros.

Rebellion

Place the King next to the Castillo (he is claustrophobic,
so don‘t throw him in). The Castillo is now the King’s
region, with all consequences. If the Castillo is scored, you
can get the King’s bonus. However, the Caballeros are not
moved to regions, throw them back in. The King remains
there until he is moved again. All regions are considered
neighboring regions of the Castillo.

Infiltration

This card breaks the most important rule in the game.
With this card, you may place your Caballeros in the
King’s region. You may split them between multiple
regions as usual.

Stand-in

You are only allowed to swap them, if both are located in
the regions (i.e. not in France, Portugal, or the Castillo).

Adopted Home

Multiple Grandes may be present in one region.
However, you are not allowed to throw your Grande into
the Castillo. You cannot place him in the King’s region
nor take him from there.

with a Grande
of your choice.

Veto

Your Majesty

The neighboring regions to France and Portugal work the
same way as usual. You can only move the King to France
or Portugal with this card.

Your Majesty

You can move the King to any region. You cannot throw
him into the Castillo and you cannot move it to France or
Portugal.
If you choose not to perform the Special action, the King
remains in place.

Prevent an entire special
action this or next round.
Everyone must announce
their special actions before
executing them.

12

Veto

Once you have chosen the Veto card, you place it face up
in front of you. You are then allowed to completely prevent
a Special action that someone wants to perform this or
next round. All others must announce their Special action
before performing it. You must immediately decide
whether you want to prevent this Special action. You
cannot cancel a Special action if it has already begun.
Discard the “Veto” card after you have used it, or latest at
the end of the next round.
