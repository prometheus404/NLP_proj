Setting up the Game
1. Place the board in the center of the table.
2. Each player takes a set of 45 plastic trains along with the matching
scoring marker.
3. Each player places their scoring marker on the 0 spot of the scoring
track running around the edge of the board . Throughout the game,
each time a player scores points, they will advance their marker
accordingly.
4. Shuffle the train cards and deal a starting hand of 4 cards to each
player .
5. Place the remaining deck of train cards near the board and turn the

top 5 cards from the deck face up. If at least 3 of the 5 face up cards
are locomotive cards, all 5 cards are immediately discarded in a face
up pile and 5 new ones are turned face up to replace them .
6. Place the longest path bonus card face up next to the board

.

7. Shuffle the tickets and deal 4 cards to each player . Each player
secretly looks at their tickets and decides which ones they wish to
keep. A player must keep at least 2, but may keep more if they choose.
Any returned cards are shuffled together and put at the bottom of the
ticket deck which is then placed next to the board .
You are now ready to begin.

Object of the Game

If you want to draw a face up locomotive, it must be the first train
card you draw this turn and you cannot then draw a second card.

The object of the game is to score the highest number of points.

Note: If you are lucky enough to get a locomotive from the top
of the deck in a blind draw, it counts as a single card and you
may still draw a total of 2 cards that turn.

You score points by:
◆ Claiming a route between 2 adjacent cities on the map

2. Claim 1 Route

◆ Successfully completing the tickets you kept
◆ Creating the longest continuous path of routes

Warning: You lose points by failing to complete tickets you kept.
CHICAGO

Completing a ticket

NEW ORLEANS

7

To complete a ticket, you need
to link both cities named on that
ticket with a continuous path of plastic trains in your color.

The Game Turn

You can use your turn to claim 1 route. A route is a set of
continuous colored spaces (in some instances, gray spaces)
between 2 adjacent cities on the map.
To claim a route, play as many train cards as the number of spaces
in the route.The set of cards played must match the color of the
route (see Example 1). Place 1 of your plastic trains on each of
these spaces, then discard the cards you used to claim the route.
Claiming the
MONTRÉAL – NEW YORK
blue route

Determine the first player by a method of your choosing. Play
then proceeds clockwise around the table, each player taking
1 turn at a time until the game ends. On your turn, you must
perform 1 (and only 1) of the following 3 actions:

Claiming the
TORONTO – PITTSBURGH
gray route

or

or

or

1. Draw train cards
2. Claim 1 route
3. Draw tickets

or

or

1. Draw Train Cards
You can use your turn to draw train cards. If you do, you may
draw 2 of them. Either of these cards can be drawn from the 5
face up cards next to the board or from the top of the deck (a
blind draw). After drawing a face up card, immediately replace
it with a new card taken from the top of the train deck.

MONTRÉAL

TORONTO

If, at any time, 3 of the 5 face up train cards are locomotives, all
5 cards are immediately discarded, and 5 new cards are turned
face up to replace them.
You may have any number of cards in your hand at any time.
When the train deck is exhausted, all discarded train cards
are reshuffled into a new deck. The cards should be shuffled
thoroughly, since most of the cards will have been discarded
in sets.
In the unlikely event that there are no cards left to draw and
there is no discard pile, a player cannot take the “draw train
cards” action. Instead they may only take the “claim 1 route”
or “draw tickets” actions.

Locomotives
Locomotives are multi-colored and are wild
cards that can be part of any color set when
claiming a route.

NEW YORK
Examples

PITTSBURGH

Notes:
● Gray routes can be claimed playing a set of cards of any 1 color

(see Example 2)

● You may only claim 1 route on your turn
● You may claim any open route on the board; it does not have

to connect to any of your other claimed routes

● You must claim the entire route in a single turn

Example

Some cities are connected by double-routes
(2 routes of the same length between the
same cities). The same player cannot claim
both of these routes.

MONTRÉAL

SAULT
STE.
MARIE

Note: In 2 player or 3 player games, only
1 of the double-routes can be claimed. A
player can claim either of the 2 routes, but
the second route is then closed; no player
can claim this second route.

When you claim a route, record the points it was worth by moving
your scoring marker on the scoring track according to this table:

3. Draw Tickets

A

ATLANT

You can use your turn to draw more tickets.
To do so, draw 3 tickets from the top of the
ticket deck. If there are fewer than 3 tickets left in the deck, only
draw the ones that are available.
You must keep at least 1 of the tickets you just drew. Any returned
tickets are placed at the bottom of the ticket deck in any order
you want.
Note: You can only discard tickets you just drew, not tickets
you already had in your hand.
Keep your tickets secret from the other players until the end of
the game. You may have any number of tickets during the game.

Game End
When a player’s stock of plastic trains gets down to only 0,1,
or 2 trains left at the end of their turn, each player, including
that player, gets 1 final turn. The game then ends, and players
calculate their final scores following this sequence:
1. Players should have already accounted for the points earned as
they completed different routes. To make sure no mistakes were
made, you may want to recount the points for each player’s routes.

CREDITS

2. Players reveal all tickets they kept. The value of successfully
completed tickets is added to their total score. The value of
any incomplete tickets is deducted from their total score (see
Example 3).

SCORING TICKETS
Blue managed to complete both the “Montréal – Atlanta” and “New
York – Atlanta” tickets, adding 15 points to their score.
On the other hand, Green completed “Sault Ste. Marie – Nashville”
but failed to complete “Atlanta – Washington” resulting in a net gain
of only 4 points.

3. The player who has the longest continuous path of plastic
trains receives the bonus card and adds 10 points to their score.
In the case of a tie for the longest path, all tied players score
the 10 bonus points.
● When evaluating and comparing path lengths, only take into

account continuous lines of plastic trains of the same color.

● A continuous path may include loops, and pass through the

same city several times, but a given plastic train may never
be counted twice in the same continuous path.

The player with the most points wins the game.
If 2 or more players are tied for the most points, the player
who has completed the most tickets wins. In the unlikely event
that they are still tied, the player among them (if any) with
the longest path card wins. Otherwise, those players share
the victory.
