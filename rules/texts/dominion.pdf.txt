You are a monarch, like your parents before you - a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers
and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes...dreams! You want a bigger and
more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers, and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!
In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums - all small bits of land, controlled by petty
lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these unfortunates, uniting them
under your banner.
But wait. It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea.
You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible while you can, fending them off
along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and
fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on
your mother's side, would be delighted.
This is a game of building a deck of cards. The deck represents your Dominion. It contains your
resources, victory points, and the things you can do. It starts out a small sad collection of
Estates and Coppers, but you hope that by the end of the game it will be brimming with Gold,
Provinces, and the inhabitants and structures of your castle and kingdom. You win by having
the most
in your deck when the game ends.

Now unwrap the card decks and place the cards in the slots of the Plastic organizer tray next to the
matching names on the Organizing Inlay. When playing a game, you will remove only the cards used in
that game and then return them to their appropriate slots after each game. By doing so, you will always
be able to easily and quickly set up a new game.

Each player takes 3 Estates and 7 Coppers and shuffles them face down as a starting deck.
Place 17 face-up piles of cards on the table: the 7 Base card piles, which are always used, and always the
same, and 10 Kingdom card piles, which vary from game to game. The full set of cards available this
game is called the Supply.

The Base cards are Copper, Silver, Gold, Estate, Duchy, Province, and Curse.
• Copper, Silver, Gold: Use every copy you have of these (except Coppers players already have).
• Estate, Duchy, Province: Use 8 copies of each for a 2-player game, 12 copies for 3-4 players.
• Curse: Use 10 with 2 players, 20 with 3 players, all 30 with 4 players.
There are 26 Kingdom cards. If you have expansions, you can use those Kingdom cards as well. Choose
10 Kingdom cards to use, however you like; the others will not be used this game. You can pick the
Kingdom cards randomly by shuffling the randomizer cards - the cards with the blue framed backs and turning over 10 of them. There are a few pre-made sets of 10 cards in the Recommended Sets
section that you can try. For your very first game of Dominion, use these cards: Cellar, Market,
Merchant, Militia, Mine, Moat, Remodel, Smithy, Village, Workshop.
Whichever 10 cards you pick, get out those piles - 10 copies of each card (do not put the randomizer
card in the pile). When a Victory Kingdom card is used (e.g. Gardens), it gets 8 copies for 2 players, 12
copies for 3-4 players, as with the other Victory cards.
Put the Trash mat near the piles.

DominionRules2021.qxp_WideDominion 8/17/23 11:33 AM Page 4

Randomly choose a starting player. If you have just played a game of Dominion and it was not a tie, have
the player who won the previous game go last (the player to their left goes first).
Each player draws an initial hand of 5 cards.

Dominion is a game of building a deck of cards. Each player has their own deck, their own discard pile,
their own hand of cards and play area. Players start with a weak initial deck and gradually acquire better
cards over the course of the game.
Players take turns. Each turn has three phases: Action, then Buy, then Clean-up, which you can
remember as ABC. In the Action phase, you can play one Action card from your hand; in the Buy phase,
you can play any number of Treasure cards and then buy one card to add to your deck; and in Clean-up
you sweep up all of your cards from play and from your hand and discard them, then draw a new hand
of 5 cards, shuffling as needed.
The game ends after 3 piles are empty or the Province pile is empty; then players count up the
of their cards, and the player with the most
wins.

on all

In your Action phase, you can play one Action card from your hand. Those are cards that say "Action" on
the bottom, and by default have a white banner (some are other colors due to additional types). Playing
an Action card has three steps: announcing it; moving it to the "in play" area - the table space in front of
you; and following the instructions on it, in order, top to bottom. If the card has a dividing line (e.g.
Moat), you stop there; instructions below the line happen at some other time (indicated). If you cannot
do everything a card tells you to do, you do as much as you can; you can still play a card even if you
know you will not be able to do everything it tells you to.
Some cards give "+1 Action." This increases how many Action cards you can play in a turn. The increase
happens right then, but you do not play the next Action card until completely finishing the first one.
Some cards give "+2 Actions"; that means you can play two more Action cards that turn.
So, for example, if you play Militia, which does not give +Actions, you resolve Militia and are done with
your Action phase. But you could instead play a Market, then another Market, then a Militia; each
Market gives you +1 Action, which lets you keep playing Actions.
Using up your Actions is optional; you can have an Action card left in hand that you can play, and decide
not to play it.

First you can play any number of Treasure cards from your hand, in any order. Treasure cards say
"Treasure" on the bottom and have a yellow banner. You play one by moving it to the "in play" area; you
probably will not announce your Treasures, though you can if you want. The Treasures have no text, just a
big coin with a number on it. You get that many coins to spend this turn - one coin for a Copper, two for
a Silver, three for a Gold, indicated as , , . The amount is also in the corners at the top of
Treasures. You do not have to play every Treasure in your hand (but only get
this turn for the Treasures
you play).
Then, you can buy one card, costing as much
as you have or less. Costs are indicated in the lower left
corner of cards. You buy a card by choosing it from the Supply, and then "gaining" it. "Gaining" a card
means moving it from the Supply to your discard pile. Your total amount of coins available to spend goes
down by the cost of the card. For example if you played four Coppers and a Silver, that makes
total; if
you bought a Market, that costs , so you would move a Market from the Supply to your discard pile
and have
left.
Buying cards does not use up Treasure cards; you still have the cards. The Treasures produce income
usable every time you draw them. Buying cards just uses up the
you have available this turn.
Some cards give "+1 Buy." This increases how many cards you can buy in a turn in your Buy phase. For
example with
and an extra Buy, you could buy two Silvers, which each cost . Using up your Buys is
optional. You can have two Buys but just buy one card, or skip buying entirely. As Copper costs , you
could use a Buy with no
to buy a Copper.
You cannot go back and play more Treasures after buying a card; first play Treasures, then buy.

Take all of the cards you have in play (both Actions and Treasures), and any remaining cards in your
hand, and put them all into your discard pile. The order does not matter; you can hide the cards from
your hand under the played cards if you want to.
Draw a new hand of 5 cards. If your deck has fewer than 5 cards, first shuffle your discard pile and put it
under your deck, then draw.

The game ends at the end of a turn, if either the Province pile is empty, or any three or more Supply piles
are empty (any piles at all, including Kingdom cards, Curses, Copper, etc.).
Take all of your cards - from your hand, deck, discard pile, play area, and even set aside cards - and sort
them for putting them back in their piles. Count up your .
The player with the most
wins. If players tie for , a player who tied but had fewer turns wins. If
players tie and had the same number of turns, they rejoice in their shared victory.

Every card has types, listed on the bottom; a color, which helps indicate certain types; and a cost, in the
lower left corner. Action cards all have a text box with instructions; sometimes other cards do.
Cards can have multiple types. A card has all of its types for all purposes. For example, Throne Room lets
you play an Action card twice; that Action could be Witch, which is an Action - Attack, or Moat, an
Action - Reaction, or Smithy, an Action.
These are the card types present in the main set (expansions add some):
• Action: These can be played in your Action phase to do what they say to do in the text box.
• Treasure: These can be played in your Buy phase to produce
used to buy cards. The amount of
is
indicated in the top corners and on a big
symbol. Treasures in expansions may have rules on them
like Action cards.
• Victory: These are generally not useful during the game, but are worth
at the end indicated by a
number next to a big
symbol.
• Curse: These are bad cards worth -1 . Normally they have no use and you will not choose to buy
them, though you can; however you may receive them from other players via Witch.
• Attack: These are cards that hurt other players directly somehow.
• Reaction: These are cards that can be used in some way at an unusual time. Any such use is spelled
out on the Reaction card; for example Moat says it can be revealed when another player plays an
Attack card. Reactions are used one at a time (which matters for expansion Reactions).

Some special terms are used in card text.
Four terms involve a number after a + symbol. +2 is the same as +1 twice, and so on.
"+1 Action" - You may play an additional Action card this turn.
• When this happens, it just adds to the number of Action cards you can play; you finish resolving the
current card before actually playing more Action cards.
• Actions are only usable in the Action phase.
• When you have multiple Actions, it can be helpful to say the number out loud to remember it. Some
players like to form a "tree" on the table, putting two played Actions on a Village or Festival to show its
Actions being used up.
"+1 Buy" - You may buy an additional card in your Buy phase this turn.
• You do not have to use extra Buys.
• You split up your
among your Buys.
"+1 Card" - Draw a card.
• You draw the card immediately.
• If you have to draw more cards than are left in your deck, you shuffle your discard pile, put it under
your deck, and then draw. If there still are not enough cards to draw, you just draw as many as you
can.
"+ " - You have an extra
to spend in your Buy phase this turn.
• + does not give you a Copper card; it just adds to how much
you can spend this turn.
Other terms involve moving cards, seeing cards, and where cards are.
"Discard a card" - Move a card from your hand to your discard pile.
• Sometimes a card will tell you to discard a card from another location, but by default discarded cards
come from hands.
• You place the discarded card on top of your discard pile, face up.
• If you discard multiple cards at once, you do not need to reveal them all, just the one you put on top.
"Gain a card" - Take a card from the Supply and put it into your discard pile.
• Sometimes a card will let you gain a card from a place other than the Supply, but by default gained
cards come from the Supply.
• Sometimes a card will let you gain a card to a location other than your discard pile, but by default all
gained cards are put into your discard pile.
• You do not play a card when you gain it; it just goes to your discard pile.
"In play" - Being in a player's play area.
• Cards become "in play" when played, and usually stay there until discarded from play in Clean-up.
• Only played cards are in play; set aside cards, cards in the trash, in the Supply, in hands, etc., are not in
play.

7

DominionRules2021.qxp_WideDominion 8/17/23 11:33 AM Page 8

"Look at a card" - You get to see the card; other players do not.
• After looking at it, return it to wherever it was (unless otherwise instructed).
"Play a card" - Put a card into play, and follow the instructions on it.
• When a card tells you to play a card, that does not use up an Action play for the turn.
• As with playing a card normally, you follow the instructions in order, stopping at a dividing line when
there is one.
• As always, played cards go into play, not directly into the discard pile.
"Reveal a card" - All players get to see the card.
• After revealing it, return it to wherever it was (unless otherwise instructed).
"Set aside a card" - Put the card on the table, outside of the play area.
• Set aside cards are not "in play."
• Set aside cards are face up unless otherwise specified.
• A card that sets a card aside will say when to move it somewhere else.
"Trash a card" - Put a card into the Trash pile.
• This is a way of getting rid of a card; a trashed card is no longer one of your cards.
• The Trash pile is on the Trash mat, face up; players may look through the Trash at any time.
• The order of the Trash pile does not matter; players can reorder it.
• Cards in the Trash are essentially out of the game, though some expansion cards can get them.
Finally there are three symbols used in text boxes.
- Victory points. The player with the most

wins.

- The coin symbol. This indicates costs of cards, and amounts of money produced.
Dividing line - Some cards have the text box divided with a line (e.g. Moat). This separates abilities that
happen at different times. When playing the card, you follow instructions above the line only; the text
below the line will say when it applies.

If you have to do anything with your deck - for example draw, look at, reveal, set aside, discard, or trash
cards - and you need more cards than are left in your deck, first shuffle your discard pile and put it
under your deck, then do the thing. If there are still not enough cards, you do the thing with however
many cards you can. If when shuffling there are no cards in your deck, the shuffled discard pile simply
becomes your new deck.
When your deck is empty, you do not shuffle until you need to do something with cards from your deck.
If you have to put a card on top of your deck when it is empty, that card becomes the only card in your
deck.

You can count the number of cards in your deck at any time (without looking at the card fronts), but
cannot look through or count your discard pile or another player's deck or discard pile. The number of
cards in each player's hand is public, as is the top card of each discard pile. All cards in play are public; set
aside cards are normally public but are sometimes face down. Players can look through the Trash pile at
any time.
When interacting with a discard pile (e.g. with Harbinger), it is not necessary to keep it in the same
order. The only thing that ever matters about that order is that the top card is public. It is also never
necessary to keep the Trash pile in a particular order.
When two things happen to different players at the same time, go in turn order starting with the player
whose turn it is. For example, when a player plays Witch, the other players gain Curses in turn order,
which may matter if the Curses run out.
When two things happen to one player at the same time, that player picks the order to do them, even if
some are mandatory and some are not. This can come up with expansions.
When a card gives you a choice ("choose one..."), you can pick any option, without considering whether
or not you will be able to do it. This comes up with expansions.

To play with 5 or 6 players, you need additional base cards. These are available in the Base Cards product
and in the Big Box, or you could have two copies of Dominion.
Most Victory piles still have 12 cards, as with 3-4 player games. However use 15 Provinces for 5 players,
and use 18 Provinces for 6 players. Use 40 Curses for 5 players, 50 Curses for 6 players.
Add all of the extra Coppers, Silvers, and Golds to those piles.
The game end condition for 5-6 players is: any four piles are empty, or the Province pile is empty.

Before the game

Shuffle your starting 10 cards (7 Coppers & 3 Estates) and place them face-down as your deck. Draw the top
5 cards as your starting hand. In this example, you have 1 Estate & 4 Coppers. The rest remain as your deck.

Mine: You can, for example, trash a Copper to gain a Silver, or trash a Silver to
gain a Gold. The Treasure you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your
hand; you can play it for
the same turn. If you do not have a Treasure to trash,
you do not gain one.

Moat: An Attack card says "Attack" on the bottom line; in this set, Bandit,
Bureaucrat, Militia, and Witch are Attacks. When another player plays an Attack
card, you may reveal a Moat from your hand, before the Attack does anything, to
be unaffected by the Attack - you do not reveal cards to Bandit, or put a Victory
card on your deck for Bureaucrat, or discard for Militia, or gain a Curse for Witch.
Moat stays in your hand, and can still be played on your next turn. Moat does
not stop anything an Attack does to other players, or for the player who played it;
it just protects you personally. Moat can also be played on your turn for +2 Cards.
If multiple Attacks are played on a turn or in a round of turns, you may reveal
Moat for as many of them as you want.

Poacher

Poacher: You draw your one card before discarding. If there are no empty piles,
you do not discard. If there is one empty pile, you discard one card; if there are
two empty piles, you discard two cards, and so on. This includes all Supply piles,
including Curses, Coppers, Poacher itself, etc. If you do not have enough cards to
discard, just discard the rest of your hand.

Remodel: You cannot trash the Remodel itself, since it is not in your hand after
you play it. If you do not have a card to trash, you do not gain one. If you do gain
a card, it comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. The gained card
does not need to cost exactly
more than the trashed card; it can cost that
much or less, and can even be another copy of the trashed card. You cannot use
to increase how expensive of a card you gain.

of your deck. You can trash both, or discard both, or put both back in either
order; or you can trash one and discard one, or trash one and put one back, or
discard one and put one back.

Throne Room: Playing an Action card from your hand is optional. If you do play
one, you resolve it completely, then play it a second time. You cannot play other
cards in-between (unless told to by the card, such as with Vassal or Throne Room
itself). Playing Action cards with Throne Room is just like playing Action cards
normally, except it does not use up Action plays for the turn. For example if you
start a turn by playing Throne Room on Village, you would draw a card, get +2
Actions, draw another card, and get +2 Actions again, leaving you with 4 Actions.
If you Throne Room a Throne Room, you may play an Action card twice, then may
play another Action card twice; you do not play one Action card four times.

Vassal: If the card is an Action card, you can play it, but do not have to. If you do
play it, you move it into your play area and follow its instructions; this does not
use up one of your Action plays for the turn.
